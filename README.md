# packwiz-installer
An installer for launching packwiz modpacks with MultiMC. You'll need [the bootstrapper](https://github.com/comp500/packwiz-installer-bootstrap/releases) to actually use this.

Manual downloading 'assistance' has been added!  In the case of each mod that do not allow third parties to download them through the api, the installer will automatically open a download URL in the system's default browser and get the downloaded mod where it needs to be.

All *you* need to do is clean up (close the download tabs after it is done downloading) and use chrome (because currently it only supports looking for downloads in Chrome's default download locations for linux, macOS, and Windows).
